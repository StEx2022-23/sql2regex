faq.heading=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.sql.heading=What is SQL?
faq.sql.text=SQL stands for Structured Query Language. They divided into the following Sub-Languages: Data-Query-Language (DQL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Control Language (DCL). SQL is the basis for interacting with databases over a database management system.
faq.sql.documentation=Syntax f\u00FCr SQL Ausdr\u00FCcke
faq.regex.heading=What is RegEx?
faq.regex.text=RegEx stands for regular expressions. Regular expressions allow you to define a set of rules for strings. You use regular expressions frequently, even if unconsciously, for example in operations such as "search and replace".
faq.regex.documentation=RegEx-Dokumentation
faq.sqlAndRegex.heading=SQL & RegEx?
faq.sqlAndRegex.text=Competency-based e-assessment and the associated digital tests make it necessary to check free-text entries against a sample solution. In the process, student answers can deviate even though they are technically correct. With the generated regular expressions, based on SQL grammar, a variety of variable answers can be covered.
faq.sqlAndRegex.documention=ONYX-Dokumentation
